rpresent - experimenting with 2D vector graphics on Raspberry Pi

At the moment, this contains some demos of OpenVG text and image rendering.

Requires:
  libfreetype6-dev
  libxml2-dev
  libmagick++-dev
  EGL, OpenGL ES 2, OpenVG
    (these can be found in /opt/vc on Raspberry Pi,
     and in mesa dev packages on desktop linux)
  bcm_host
    (on Raspberry Pi only)

Build and run on Raspberry Pi (tested on raspbian):
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DPLATFORM=PI ../
  make
  src/rpresent

Build and run for X11 on desktop linux:
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DPLATFORM=X11 ../
  make
  src/rpresent

Using a cross-compilation toolchain named 'arm-raspbian-linux-gnueabi-gcc'
(built using crosstool-ng and with Raspberry Pi headers and libs copied in)
Cross-compile for Raspberry Pi:
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DPLATFORM=PI -DCROSS_COMPILE=TRUE
  make
